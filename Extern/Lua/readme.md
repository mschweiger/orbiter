# luajit-cmake

CMake build-system for LuaJIT. This is meant for using LuaJIT as a library
in an existing CMake project. Specifically intended for FetchContent. LuaJIT
source is automatically gathered from
[https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT) using
FetchContent as well.

Fork of
[https://github.com/zhaozg/luajit-cmake](https://github.com/zhaozg/luajit-cmake),
with significant portions removed as they are not needed for my purposes.
